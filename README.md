# Global Emissions Dashboard

Despite the huge number of insights available to us thanks to technology and scientific methods, many countries and international organizations fail to incorporate data into their policy making [(1)](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99739/principles_of_evidence-based_policymaking.pdf). While 'Evidence-Based Policy Making' is critiqued [(2)](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/263288), and getting to a point where data is used everywhere will be challenging, building easily accessible, user-friendly, and free resources is vital to helping everyone build a more fact-based view of the world.

With that, this interactive dashboard aims to increase awareness on the realities of carbon dioxide and GHG emissions from the industrial era forward. It measures emissions from a variety of sources measuring from the year 1750 to 2020, and was built using the R Shiny package. Please share the link with friends and family if you found something interesting.
