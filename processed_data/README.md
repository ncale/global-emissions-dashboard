## Processed Data

The global emissions data used was curated and processed by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). It includes annual, per capita, cumulative, and consumption-based data on co2 and other GHGs. This data is also updated regularly.

Instead of downloading here, the data is loaded directly from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv) on the [owid github page](https://github.com/owid). This method decreases the project file size and ensures the dashboard is as up-to-date as is available.
